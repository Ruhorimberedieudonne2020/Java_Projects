The safety of transactions on the Internet depends on the encryption system used. The better this encryption system, the more difficult it is for any person to hack the application. </font></font></font></p><p>
<font color=#000000 face=" Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Internationally, the best system available today, is the 128-bit encryption. Investmentz.com is one of the few online share-trading sites in the country equipped with this 128-bit encryption. <br><br> 
Secondly, you too can ensure the safety of the transactions online. You normally get a secured user id and password, the secrecy of which is to be maintained entirely by you. <br><br>
Thirdly, if the transaction system requires no manual intervention, you further improve the safety in the transactions. This eliminates the possibility of any manual intervention. It means that orders are directly sent to the exchange ensuring that you get the best and right price. <br>

<b>What about security of my money, demat shares and my transaction documents?</b> 
<br>In systems where the broking, banking and demat accounts are completely integrated, your money remains in your own bank account and does not get transferred to the broker's pool account.<br><br>

<b>Is trading through the Internet a difficult and cumbersome process? </b><br>
The experience of trading through Internet depends a great deal on the type of product offered by the application. For example, the paperwork involved after every trade in writing cheque or TIFDs. <br><br>
You would then seek a system that eliminates these processes. <br><br>
In online trading, the greater the back-end integration of the system and the amount of work the sites do for you, the greater is the convenience available to you. <br><br>

<b>I am not comfortable with Internet or with finance, how can online trading be easy for me?</b><br>
Contrary to common perceptions, trading through Internet does not require either any expertise in working on the computer or any special financial skills. <br><br>
You can try the demonstration of the online trading sites to find out why others like you, with little or no knowledge about the Internet or finance, have switched to online trading. You can attend the demonstrations held by websites in your city. <br><br>

<a name=a5></a><br><b>Is trading through the Internet a costly affair? </b><br>
The convenience provided by online trading is worth thanthe costs involved. <br><br>
The online trading sites are not too costly. For example, a trader can trade shares on margin at rates as low as 0.10%* and if one wishes to trade in cash, then the rates applicable are as low as 0.4%*. <br><br>
However, it is important to compare various online trading sites on brokerage rates, inclusive of all sub-charges. <br><br>
